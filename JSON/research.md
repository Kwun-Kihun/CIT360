JSON

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate.
Although originally derived from the JavaScript scripting language, JSON data can be generated and parsed with a wide variety of programming languages including JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby and Java.
These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.

In addition, JSON is a syntax for storing and exchanging data, and it is an easier-to-use alternative to XML. The JSON format is syntactically identical to the code for creating JavaScript objects. Because of this similarity, instead of using a parser (like XML does), a JavaScript program can use standard JavaScript functions to convert JSON data into native JavaScript objects.
