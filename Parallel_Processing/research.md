Parallel Processing

Parallel processing is a method of simultaneously breaking up and running program tasks on multiple microprocessors, thereby reducing processing time. Parallel processing may be accomplished via a computer with two or more processors or via a computer network.

Parallel processing is particularly useful when running programs that perform complex computations, and it provides a viable option to the quest for cheaper computing alternatives. Supercomputers commonly have hundreds of thousands of microprocessors for this purpose. Parallel processing should not be confused with concurrency, which refers to multiple tasks that run simultaneously.
