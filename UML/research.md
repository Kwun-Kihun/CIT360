Use Case Document

Use case diagrams are used to gather the requirements of a system including internal and external influences. These requirements are mostly design requirements. So when a system is analyzed to gather its functionalities use cases are prepared and actors are identified. This is useful to used to gather requirements of a system, Used to get an outside view of a system, Identify external and internal factors influencing the system, Show the interacting among the requirements are actors.

Drawing Use Case Diagrams

Use case diagrams are considered for high level requirement analysis of a system. So when the requirements of a system are analyzed the functionalities are captured in use cases. It need to contain functionalities to be represented as an use case, Actors, and Relationships among the use cases and actors.

Use case diagrams are drawn to capture the functional requirements of a system. So after identifying the above items we have to follow the following guidelines to draw an efficient use case diagram.

The name of a use case is very important. So the name should be chosen in such a way so that it can identify the functionalities performed. Give a suitable name for actors.Show relationships and dependencies clearly in the diagram. Do not try to include all types of relationships. Because the main purpose of the diagram is to identify requirements. Use note when ever required to clarify some important points.

Sample of Use Case Diagram - Places where use case diagrams are used requirement analysis and high level design. Model the context of a system. Reverse engineering. Forward engineering.
