Java Collections

A Collection is a lot like an Array, it hold references to other objects. Unlike an Array, collections are dynamic, in an array you needd to give it the amount of objects you want to hold, in a list of a set is dinamic and it can change by itself.

Lists and Collections have built-in functions like add, remove, get, size, etc.

There some essential part of the collection.

LIST: Functions much like a variable sized array. Each entry has an index and items can be added and taken away
SET: Things are there, or they arenâ€™t. There is no duplication of items, no order or indexing. Good for a dictionary or to see if there is an entry in a list of items
MAP: Good for tracking association of keys and values
QUEUE: Like a list, but you are only concerned with the end; what goes in and out. Usually adding to one side and removing form the other, like a line or a sequential to-do list

This is the topic I focus and spent time trying to learn. Java Collections are pretty useful for transferring data between classes and over sockets. I still need to figure how to organize my program so I researched some examples on the internet. 

In the collections1.java it will create a list and add each one of the objects in the list and printing them. The collections2.java it will create two different arrays of items, List1 and List2, in the string x it will add each one of the things in List1 and printing it. In the List2 it works same thing and in order to print it, it will need to change List1.size() to List2.size() and List1.get to List2.get
