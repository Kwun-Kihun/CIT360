HIBERNATE

Hibernate is is an object-relational mapping framework for the Java language, providing a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a traditional relational database. It can be installed alongside java and can work to integrate communication between the two with many features to support the mapping. 

Hibernate was started in 2001 by Gavin King with colleagues from Cirrus Technologies as an alternative to using EJB2-style entity beans. Its original goal was to offer better persistence capabilities than offered by EJB2 by simplifying the complexities and supplementing missing features.

Mapping Java classes to database tables is accomplished through the configuration of an XML file or by using Java Annotations. When using an XML file, Hibernate can generate skeleton source code for the persistence classes.
