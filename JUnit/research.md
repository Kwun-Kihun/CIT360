JUnit 

JUnit is a simple framework to write repeatable tests. It is an instance of the xUnit architecture for unit testing frameworks.
JUnit has been important in the development of test-driven development, and is one of a family of unit testing frameworks which is collectively known as xUnit that originated with SUnit.
It is linked as a JAR at compile-time; the framework resides under package junit.framework.

JUnit promotes the idea of "first testing then coding", which emphasis on setting up the test data for a piece of code which can be tested first and then can be implemented .
This approach is like "test a little, code a little, test a little, code a little..." which increases programmer productivity and stability of program code that reduces programmer stress and the time spent on debugging.

JUnit allows the developer to incrementally build test suites to measure progress and detect unintended side effects. Tests can be run continuously. Results are provided immediately. 
JUnit shows test progress in a bar that is normally green but turns red when a test fails.

json_decode — Decodes a JSON string
json_encode — Returns the JSON representation of a value
json_last_error_msg — Returns the error string of the last json_encode() or json_decode() call
json_last_error — Returns the last error occurred
