Java Collections
This is the topic I focus and spent time trying to learn. Java Collections are pretty useful for transferring data between classes and over sockets. I still need to figure how to organize my program so I researched some examples on the internet. One of the things that really started to make sense was this last week while I was working on a program for a calculator in Java Collection. I also need to figure how to make and design controller like TV remote. I t should be control all functions in the calculator, and I might need to research more about GUI interface for the calculator.
The below links are examples of calculator.

Hibernate
Hibernate ORM enables developers to more easily write applications whose data outlives the application process. As an Object/Relational Mapping (ORM) framework, Hibernate is concerned with data persistence as it applies to relational databases. Even though I researed about Hibernate, I barely use it so I try to find some examples from Bro. Barney’s one, and he had provided an example of how Hibernate works on his GitHub, so I was able to run his program to see how different aspects of Hibernate run. 
The below links are examples of Hibernate that I used.

UML Class Diagram
Before I use UML class Diagram I researched and reviewed about UML Diagram. I will use a Class Diagram as a part of the design of my calculation application for the future. The class diagram will help to identify the necessary classes and interfaces in my app. I need to work with it.
The below links are examples of class diagram that I found.
