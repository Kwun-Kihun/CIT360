MVC

Model–view–controller (MVC) is a software architectural pattern for implementing user interfaces.
It divides a given software application into three interconnected parts, so as to separate internal representations of information from the ways that information is presented to or accepted from the user.

MVC was one of the seminal insights in the early development of graphical user interfaces, and one of the first approaches to describe and implement software constructs in terms of their responsibilities.

-	Model: Usually a Java Object,  carries data and updates the controller
-	View: Visual representation of the data
-	Controller: works with both the model and the view to control the data flow and assignment
